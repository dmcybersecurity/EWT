The Hubble Source Catalog (HSC) is a database of astronomical objects detected in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The latest version of the catalog is HSCv3, released in 2021. Here are some examples of objects that are available in the HSCv3 catalog:  
  
Galaxies - The HSC catalog contains over 3.5 million galaxy objects detected in Hubble Space Telescope images. These objects are classified based on their shape and size, and their properties such as luminosity and redshift are also provided.  
  
Stars - The catalog also contains over 12 million star objects detected in Hubble images. These objects are classified based on their brightness and color, and their properties such as distance and age are also provided.  
  
Planetary Nebulae - The HSC catalog includes over 10,000 planetary nebula objects detected in Hubble images. These objects are formed when a star sheds its outer layers as it nears the end of its life, and the ejected material glows brightly in the light of the central star.  
  
Supernovae - The catalog contains over 12,000 supernova objects detected in Hubble images. These objects are formed when a massive star explodes at the end of its life, and they emit a burst of light that can be detected by telescopes like Hubble.  
  
Quasars - The HSC catalog includes over 12,000 quasar objects detected in Hubble images. These are extremely distant and luminous objects powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.  
  
These are just a few examples of the types of objects available in the HSCv3 catalog. The catalog also includes many other types of astronomical objects, as well as detailed information on their properties and characteristics.
